Story generation based on reordering passages

**The first Matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect, it was a work of art, flawless, sublime. A triumph equaled only by its monumental failure. The inevitability of its doom is apparent to me now as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human being. Thus, I redesigned it based on your history to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature. However, I was again frustrated by failure. I have since come to understand that the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind, or perhaps a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection.**---The Architect

The program takes advantage of human falliablity ("apophenia") to create a story.

The program is loaded with several pre-written passages, and then some of them are selected randomly to be shown to the user. Between each passage is a "transition phase" that links the two passages together. The reader assumes that there is a connection between the paragraphs and sees a 'story'.

The end result is that multiple different plots can be generated by the program, even when most of the words themselves are the same.
