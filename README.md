Story generation based on reordering passages

**The first Matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect, it was a work of art, flawless, sublime. A triumph equaled only by its monumental failure. The inevitability of its doom is apparent to me now as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human being. Thus, I redesigned it based on your history to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature. However, I was again frustrated by failure. I have since come to understand that the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind, or perhaps a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection.**---The Architect

The program works by having several pre-written passages, which are then randomly ordered. Between each passage is a "transition" that links the two passages together. The end result is that multiple differnet plots can be generated by this program, even when most of the words themselves are the same.
