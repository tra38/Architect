# Architect
Story generation based on reordering passages

**The first Matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect, it was a work of art, flawless, sublime. A triumph equaled only by its monumental failure. The inevitability of its doom is apparent to me now as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human being. Thus, I redesigned it based on your history to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature. However, I was again frustrated by failure. I have since come to understand that the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind, or perhaps a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection.**---The Architect

The program works by having several pre-written passages, which are then randomly ordered. Between each passage is a "transition" that links the two passages together. The end result is that multiple differnet plots can be generated by this program, even when most of the words themselves are the same.

Example Plots:
Bob went on a quest to find the Holy Grail.
Bob found the Holy Grail, but it was being guarded by the evil Tom.
Bob and Tom fought with each other. Bob won.
By defeating Tom, Bob was able to impress a Significant Other.
