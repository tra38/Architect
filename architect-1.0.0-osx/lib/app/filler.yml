introduction:
  - I remember it like yesterday.
  - "I remember one case … I was fresh on the force, with a thin mustache and a thinner wallet … but even back then, I had a sharp nose for hot leads."
  - "I was still a rookie then, just another gumshoe bumbling his way through the concrete jungle."
  - "It was a bad week in a bad month; maybe even a bad year. The Times was calling it the worst crime spike the city had ever seen."
  - "It was a crisp day, with a stiff, brisk breeze. Leaves mingled with trash as they blew through the alleys and side streets."
  - It was a dark and stormy night.
  - "It was a dark day—maybe normal for this time of year, but today the big city felt even darker and more sinister."
  - It was a few years back. I’d just gotten on the force.
  - "It was a heatwave; the worst in years. Scalding, scorching, sweltering … so hot, the newsies had gone on strike. Hell, even the thermometers went on strike … about 20 degrees ago."
  - "It was an oppressively hot day in the city. The blacktop was baking, and the broads working 42nd and Main were wearing even less than usual."
  - It was another one of those days.
  - "It was as hot as I’d ever remembered. Just blistering. You could cook breakfast right on the sidewalk—that is, if you could bear to eat off the filthiest imaginable surface on earth."
  - "It was bitterly cold out on the streets. Even the dames working 42nd and Main were bundled up. At least the wind had died down … for the moment."
  - "It was blustery out. The snow was coming in sideways, hard. It had only been a few hours and the streets were already a cold, brown mush."
  - It was brisk. The wind blew right through your jacket like it was a sieve.
  - "It was cold out—so cold, it even drove the beggars inside. My gloves stuck to the door handle for a moment as I clambered out of my car."
  - It was freezing. I nearly slipped on the ice outside the door.
  - It was raining; the kind of rain you’d hope would clean the filth right off the streets.
  - "It was the kind of cool, black night that clung to you like something real … a black, tangible fabric of smoke, deceit, and murder."
  - "It was what folks call the dead of winter. The dirt had mixed with the ice and snow until the alleys were plastered in a crunchy, gritty brown."
  - Listen … it started like this.
  - "Rain. Hard, drumming, pounding rain. It’d been coming down for hours."
  - "Smog mixed with the muggy air. It was stifling. I wanted to run away from this flith… but there was pressing business to attend to."
  - Snow. Since when the hell did it snow around here? And it was coming down in buckets.
  - So there I was.
  - "The heat roiled off the pavement. Here in the city, the air was stifling."
  - "The air downtown was cool and moist, and the clouds were heavy—laden and ripe with rain."
  - "The lights, the smoke, the grime … the city itself seemed alive that day."
  - "The weather had turned colder than my ex-wife’s heart."
  - "This one could bring the 42nd Precinct to its knees, and maybe the whole city down with it."
conclusion:
  - "I briefly glanced out the window, then loaded my gun. The rounds found their way home with a satisfying click."
  - I jotted down the details and silently cried to myself.
  - "Guess I shoulda retired when I had the chance."
  - "I shoulda got out when I had the chance."
  - Why can’t they ever be simple?
  - I need a drink.
  - I need a promotion.
  - I need a raise.
  - Guess I’ll be working late tonight.
  - What a way to end the week.
